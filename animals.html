    <h3>Why we believe that emotional support animals are important!</h3>
    <section id="Whythishelps">
        <ul>
            <li>Emotional Stability:
                Support animals provide comfort during stressful times like exams, homesickness, or social anxiety, helping students regulate their emotions more effectively.
            </li>
            <li >Reduced Loneliness:
                Living away from home can feel isolating—having a support animal offers consistent companionship and helps reduce feelings of loneliness.</li>
            <li >Mental Health Support:
                ESAs can help alleviate symptoms of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and panic disorders by providing calming, nonjudgmental presence.</li>
            <li >Structure and Routine:
                Caring for an animal adds daily structure—feeding, walking, playtime—which can improve a student’s time management, motivation, and sense of responsibility.
            </li>
            <li >Improved Academic Performance:
                When students feel emotionally supported and less anxious, they tend to concentrate better and perform more confidently in class.
            </li>
            <li >Social Connection:
                Animals often act as social bridges, helping shy or introverted students start conversations and form friendships more easily.
            </li>
