                    <h2>How It Works</h2>
                    <p> Mental Wealth Education Services connects students with free therapy and emotional support animals .
                     Start by completing a quick, confidential survey to help us understand your mental health needs, lifestyle, and preferences.
                        Based on your responses, we match you with a licensed therapist who are completely free, with options for virtual or in-person meetings.
                        If you need daily emotional comfort, you can request an in-dorm emotional support animal, such as a dog, cat, or other small pet, through our partnerships with local shelters and certified trainers.
                        Once you’re matched, we stay with you on your journey through ongoing support, including regular check-ins.
                        Everything we offer is designed to be free, confidential, and student-approved, because we believe mental health should be a right, not a privilege.
